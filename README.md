## 🚀 Getting Started

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
[   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-study-planner.git
](https://github.com/MallikarjunBaradenal/smart-study-planner) 
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   - Double-click `index.html` to open in your default browser
   - Or use a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (with http-server)
   npx http-server
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

4. **Create an account or use demo**
   - Register with any email/password
   - Or use demo: `mallikarjunbaradenal@gmail.com` / `Mallu@123`

## 📋 How It Works

### 1. **Registration & Login**
- Create a new account or login with existing credentials
- All user data is encrypted and stored in browser LocalStorage
- No server communication - complete privacy

### 2. **Create Study Plan**
- Add subjects with difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Set number of topics for each subject
- Specify your exam date and available study hours per day
- Click "Generate Smart Study Plan"

### 3. **Smart Algorithm**
The algorithm works as follows:

```
1. Calculate total difficulty weight:
   - Easy: 1x multiplier
   - Medium: 1.5x multiplier
   - Hard: 2.5x multiplier

2. Allocate study hours:
   - Total hours = Days available × Hours per day
   - Hours per subject = (Subject weight / Total weight) × Total hours

3. Schedule topics:
   - Distribute topics across available days
   - Add revision sessions using spaced repetition:
     * 1st revision: 1 day later
     * 2nd revision: 3 days later
     * 3rd revision: 7 days later
     * Final revision: 14 days later

4. Generate daily schedule:
   - Create study sessions with breaks
   - Color-code by subject
   - Save to LocalStorage
```

### 4. **Track Progress**
- Mark topics as completed in the Progress page
- View real-time analytics and charts
- Monitor subject-wise performance
- Track days remaining until exam

### 5. **Study Schedule**
- View personalized daily study plan
- Follow recommended sessions with breaks
- Use calendar view for weekly overview
- Adjust pace as needed

## 🔐 Data Storage

All data is stored in **browser LocalStorage**:

```javascript
// Users (hashed password)
localStorage.users: [
  { id, name, email, password (hashed), createdAt }
]

// Current session
localStorage.currentUser: { id, name, email, createdAt }

// Study plans
localStorage.studyPlans: {
  userId: { subjects, weeklySchedule, progress, ... }
}

// Progress tracking
localStorage.progress: { userId: { topicId: status } }
```

**Note**: LocalStorage has a ~5-10MB limit per domain, which is more than enough for this application.
